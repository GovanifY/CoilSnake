**CoilSnake** is a tool for modifying the ROM image of the 1995 Super Nintendo game *EarthBound*. It allows users to first extract data from the ROM image, then modify the extracted data, and finally re-compile the data into a new ROM image. CoilSnake supports modification of most of the data in the game, such as:
* sprites
* maps
* the script and text
* battle backgrounds
* items
* enemies
* and more!
