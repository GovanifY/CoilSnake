**CoilSnake** is a program for modifying the ROM image of the 1995 Super Nintendo game *EarthBound*. It allows users to
extract data from the ROM image, modify the extracted data, and then re-compile the data into a new ROM image.
CoilSnake supports modification of most of the data in the game, such as:

* sprites
* maps
* the script and text
* battle backgrounds
* items
* enemies
* and more!
