**CoilSnake** is a program for modifying the ROM image of the 1995 game *EarthBound* for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
It reads gameplay-related data from individual, easily modifiable files and compiles that data into the ROM image.


CoilSnake supports modification of most of the data in the game, including:
* maps
* sprites
* the script and text
* enemies and items
* battle backgrounds
* and more!
